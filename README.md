# DTC_docker-workshop
Workshop Repository for Module 1 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp offered by datatalks.club

Note: Structure may be changed in the following days so that all modules solutions will be stored here (instead of a repo for each module)

Here you will find:
the [ingestion](./pipeline/ingest_data.py) script
the [sql](./pipeline/solutionQueries.sql) queries for the homework
the [Dockerfile](./pipeline/Dockerfile) for the ingestion script
the [Docker-Compose](./pipeline/docker-compose.yaml) for the database and pgadmin container
